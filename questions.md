+ What is a laymans definition of enumberables?
  # you  use them to iterate over collections, (hashes, arrays). It's a module that's included on those classes

+ still confused about how instance variables are set with the setter method and how when you manipulate the setter method to incorporate more conditional complexities(i.e. in the OO person lab), how the variable processes how to reset itself?
+ What is the regex resource posted on Slack last week, that has since been deleted?
  # regexone.com
+ can you explain how the setter and getter method principles work for variables that are set equal to another (or "belong to") another class (i.e. - hotline_bling.artist = drake)
+ When we store an instance in an array (e.g. @songs << song), does that store a copy of the instance or does it just reference the instance? i.e. can we alter the instance after adding it the array and see those changes reflected in the array element? Is there a way to force the non-default behavior?
+ what's the simplest way to create a file with the touch command in a specific directory other than cd'ing into it first
